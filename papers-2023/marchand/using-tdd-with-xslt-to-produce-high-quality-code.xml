  <para>At OXiane, we produce a lot of courses, we sell and teach. We were using office tools,
  like LibreOffice Writer and LibreOffice Impress. But it was difficult for us to make a clear
  distinction between a source document, that can be edited, and a production document, that is
  archived to know which slides has been used for which session. And being many writers to work
  together is not easy with such tools.</para>

  <para>For this reasons, and for editorial contraints, we decided that a Oxiane Course will be
  a project, that contains sources for slides, source for exercise book, where sources are text
  files, and that we will build the production files by a build process.</para>
  
  <para>This drives us to write various tools to transform text source files into PDF or HTML
  outputs. And we wanted to have high quality tools, so we decided to apply lessons learn from
  Software Craftsmanship.</para>

  <section>
    <title>TDD : where does it comes from ?</title>

    <para>Test Driven Development was originaly introduced by Kent Beck in eXtreme Programming explained<biblioref linkend="xp-explained"/>
      in 2004, but was already used since the beginning of extreme programming in the end of 90's.</para>

    <para>Extreme programming was a set of responses to the high costs, poor quality, unpredictable delays
      of software, and TDD focuses on quality. Quality is defined by readability, robustness and maintanability.</para>

    <section>
      <title>The TDD loop and the refactoring phase</title>
      <para>Test Driven Development consists in first writing a test that describes a business requirement ;
        this test, when executed, must fail. Then, it consists in writing the minimum of code that make the
        test succeed. At this point, the business requirement described by the test is fully implemented,
        and business code can be delivered. But probably, the code isn't readable, isn't robust, has some
        duplications, and must be refactored to remove all duplications, to be easily readable and understandable,
        and to become robust.</para>
      <para>This process is known as the TDD loop. And the most important phase of this loop is the
        refactoring phase. It's in this phase that we introduce methods that hides the technical complexity,
        and that describes the business intent. Once the business intent is clearly exposed in code, the code is
        readable, understandable, and code is easy to modify.</para>
      <para>Refactoring is a process where we have to rewrite the code without changing any behavior. The
        sole way to guarantee this is to have unit tests, and to run unit tests each time we modify code,
        and to check that all tests succeed. If tests still succeed, program behavior has not been changed.</para>

    <title>Writing a MarkDown to HTML converter with XSLT</title>

    <para>The business purpose is to be able to write OXiane exercices books with only pure text. We do not
      want anymore any office tool, as they use binary file formats. These binary file formats are not
      fully supported by version control tools, such as Git. Ans all course writers at OXiane are developers
      that use Git every day.</para>
    
    <para>So we need a pure text file format, easy to write and to structurate, and we need tools to transform
      this text-based file format to various outputs : LibreOffice for backward compatibility, Microsoft
      Office because some of our clients expect this file format, PDF for printers, and HTML for students -
      that's much comfortable for them to use than PDF.</para>
    
    <para>The semantics requirements are very limited : paragraphs, three levels of titles, two levels of
      list-items, pictures, code blocks, bold text, inline code, links and anchors, and bold text in code
      blocks.</para>
    
    <para>As MarkDown is commonly used in tools such as GitLab, we decided to use a limited subset of
      MarkDown, with special extensions to have bold text in code blocks. But it is really a limited subset,
      and we do not want to allow any writer to use some editorial features not allowed in our editorial
      rules. So, using an existing MarkDown converter was not a solution. We decided so to write our own
      MarkDown converter.</para>
    
    <section>
      <title>Feature definition</title>
      
      <para>A course is a git repository. It contains a slide-deck, edited by an OXiane tool, and serialized
        in JSon, and this tool is not related to this paper. And it contains an exercice book, edited by
        any text editor in our own MarkDown flavor. It is also a project that is build by a continuous
        integration process, and this build process must produce the slide-deck in pdf format, and the
        exercice book in PDF and Html formats. LibreOffice and MS Office formats has been made obsolete.
        For both slide-deck and exercice book, two flavors are produced, one for screen, one for print.</para>
      
      <para>We need a tool that is able to transform MarkDown to Html, to PDF, and a
        What-You-See-Is-What-You-Get browser-based editor. Transformation process must be quick and efficient,
        as WYSISWYG editor must be fluid. As this tool is written by a course-writers team, and as there is no
        credit to maintain this tool, it must be very robust, it must be very easy to evolve if new features are
        required in the future. It must provide comprehensive error message when transformation fails, to
        help the writer to correct its document, without requiring a developer assistance.</para>
    </section>
    
    <section>
      <title>Tooling</title>
      
      <para>As XSLT is able to run embeded in a Java Program, and in a browser, we choose XSLT to write
        the transformer program. Because we've used Saxon for a while, Saxon XSLT processor will be
        used.</para>
      
      <para>XSpec is a Unit Test framework, that can be used to test XSLT, XQuery and Schematron. XSpec
      has been present for a while, but is actively maintained by <author><personname>AirQuick</personname></author>
      and <author><personname>Galtm</personname></author></para>
      
      <para>OXygen XML Developer<biblioref linkend="oxygen-xml-developer"/> is a really convinient Development environment for XSLT, it embeds Saxon,
        and XSpec. We will use OXygen XML Developer to develop this tool.</para>
    </section>
    
    <section>
      <title>Methods</title>
      
      <para>As Software Craftsmanship practitioners, we will use Test Driven Development to develop our
        transformer. Even it's not commonly used with XSLT, it has proven that if correctly practised, it
        produces high quality code.</para>

    <title>Implementation</title>
    
    <section>
      <title>Level 1 titles</title>
      
      <para>We want to transform a <code># Title 1</code> line into an XML element <code>&lt;title>Title 1&lt;/title></code>.</para>
      
      <para>Test Driven Development says we <emphasis>must</emphasis> write a test that describes the business
        requirement, before coding any production code. XSpec is a framework where we can describe business
        requirements as scenarios, with context and expectations.</para>
      <para>Let's write such a scenario</para>
      
      <example>
        <title>XSpec 1</title>
        <programlisting language="xml"><![CDATA[<x:description 
  xmlns:x="http://www.jenitennison.com/xslt/xspec"
  stylesheet="../../main/xsl/md-to-xml.xsl"
  xslt-version="3.0">

  <x:scenario label="Title 1">
    <x:context select="'# Title 1'" mode="convert"/>
    <x:expect label="A title element with text in">
      <title>Title 1</title>
    </x:expect>
  </x:scenario>
</x:description>]]></programlisting>
      </example>
      
      <para>If we run this XSpec scenario, it fails, and says that <code>../../main/xsl/md-to-xml.xsl
        does not exist</code>. Correct. A test that does not compile is a failing test. We are allowed
        to write production code to make the test compile.</para>
      
      <para>So we create the missing file, with the minimum code to make the test compile.</para>

      <example>
        <title>XSLT 1</title>
        <programlisting language="xml"><![CDATA[<xsl:stylesheet 
  xmlns:xsl="http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform"
  version="3.0">
  
</xsl:stylesheet>]]></programlisting>
      </example>

      <para>With this file, the unit tests executes, but fails to succeed. We can now write the minimum
        code to make the test succeed :</para>


    <example>
      <title>XSLT 2</title>
      <programlisting language="xml"><![CDATA[<xsl:stylesheet 
  xmlns:xsl="http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform"
  version="3.0">
  
  <xsl:template match=".[. eq '# Title 1']" mode="convert">
    <title>Title 1</title>
  </xsl:template>
</xsl:stylesheet>]]></programlisting>
    </example>

      <para>If we run again the unit test, it now succeeds. First part of TDD loop is completed, the code
        behaves as expected. But the code is very specific, and not very easy to understand ; business
        intention can not be quickly understood, and that's a problem. In <biblioref linkend="clean-code"/>,
        Bob Martin explains that we have to improve readability, it makes code easier to maintain.</para>
      
      <para>To refactor code, we can process by hand, and apply manually various refactoring operations, like
        Extract Function<biblioref linkend="REFACTO-extract-function"/> ; we can also use OXygen's implementation of
        this operation, it will be quicker :</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>Select <code>. eq '#Title 1'</code></para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>Right Click on it / Refactoring / Extract Function</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>It asks for a function name, let's type <code>prv:isTitle1</code> and validate</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>OXygen generates the function, defines the namespace alias, and replace the ugly code by the function call :</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <example>
      <title>XSLT 3</title>
      <programlisting language="xml"><![CDATA[<xsl:stylesheet 
  xmlns:xsl="http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform"
  version="3.0"
  xmlns:prv="http://www.example.com/fn">
  
  <xsl:function name="prv:isTitle1">
    <xsl:value-of select=". eq '# Title 1'"/>
  </xsl:function>
  <xsl:template match=".[prv:isTitle1()]" mode="convert">
    <title>Title 1</title>
  </xsl:template>
</xsl:stylesheet>]]></programlisting>
    </example>
    
    <para>Let's run again the unit test, it fails. The function does not have any parameter, no context
      item, so it can not compare text. Let's introduce a parameter ; OXygen does not provide a Introduce
      parameter<biblioref linkend="REFACTO-introduce-parameter-object"/> nor a Change function declaration<biblioref linkend="REFACTO-change-function-declaration"/>,
      so we have to do it manually :</para>
      
    <example>
      <title>XSLT 4</title>
      <programlisting language="xml"><![CDATA[<xsl:stylesheet 
  xmlns:xsl="http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform"
  version="3.0"
  xmlns:prv="http://www.example.com/fn"
  xmlns:xs="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema">
  
  <xsl:function name="prv:isTitle1">
    <xsl:param name="line" as="xs:string"/>
    <xsl:value-of select="$line eq '# Title 1'"/>
  </xsl:function>
  <xsl:template match=".[prv:isTitle1(.)]" mode="convert">
    <title>Title 1</title>
  </xsl:template>
</xsl:stylesheet>
]]></programlisting>
    </example>
      
    <para>The test succeeds. But function is at the beginning of the code, and it hides the business
      part. Let's apply the Slide Statement<biblioref linkend="REFACTO-slide-statement"/> refactoring operation, to move
      the function at the bottom of the file :</para>
    <example>
      <title>XSLT 5</title>
      <programlisting language="xml"><![CDATA[<xsl:stylesheet 
  xmlns:xsl="http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform"
  version="3.0"
  xmlns:prv="http://www.example.com/fn"
  xmlns:xs="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema">
  
  <xsl:template match=".[prv:isTitle1(.)]" mode="convert">
    <title>Title 1</title>
  </xsl:template>
  
  <xsl:function name="prv:isTitle1">
    <xsl:param name="line" as="xs:string"/>
    <xsl:value-of select="$line eq '# Title 1'"/>
  </xsl:function>
</xsl:stylesheet>]]></programlisting>
    </example>

    <para>Now, we can read the XSL file, and understand that it is used to convert all lines that are a
      <code>title1</code>, and transform it to a random element. We do not need to know exactly what is a
      <code>title1</code>, and which technical rules apply to identify a <code>title1</code>. We just know
      that this template processes all <code>title1</code> lines.</para>

    <para>This second part of TDD loop, the refactoring part, is the most important phase of TDD. It's the
      phase where we make business rules emerge from the code.</para>
      
    <para>What a pitty, Oxygen is not very precise in refactoring, and it generates code that has to be
      manually fixed. The generated function should be typed as boolean, but isn't. It's an error,
      and we know this because we have good skills in XSLT. But we can not write new code without a failing
      test. So we write a test that shows the function is not correct and must return a <code>xs:boolean</code>.</para>
      
    <example>
      <title>XSpec 2</title>
      <programlisting language="xml"><![CDATA[<x:description 
  xmlns:x="http://www.jenitennison.com/xslt/xspec"
  xmlns:prv="http://www.example.com/fn"
  stylesheet="../../main/xsl/md-to-xml.xsl"
  xslt-version="3.0">
  
  <x:scenario label="Title 1">
    <x:context select="'# Title 1'" mode="convert"/>
    <x:expect label="A title element with text in">
      <title>Title 1</title>
    </x:expect>
  </x:scenario>    
  
  <x:scenario label="testing isTitle1">
    <x:scenario label="# Title 1">
      <x:call function="prv:isTitle1">
        <x:param># Title 1</x:param>
      </x:call>
      <x:expect label="Title 1" select="true()"/>
    </x:scenario>
  </x:scenario>
</x:description>]]></programlisting>
    </example>
      
      <para>Here, we precisely define we expect a <code>xs:boolean</code>. We we run the test, it fails. Types are different.
        Let's correct production code just add <code>as</code> attribute :</para>
      <example>
        <title>XSLT 6</title>
        <programlisting language="xml"><![CDATA[  <xsl:function name="prv:isTitle1" as="xs:boolean">
    <xsl:param name="line" as="xs:string"/>
    <xsl:value-of select="$line eq '# Title 1'"/>
  </xsl:function>]]></programlisting>
      </example>
      
      <para>And here, Oxygen shows a warning on mis-use of value-of. We replace it with a sequence :</para>

      <example>
        <title>XSLT 7</title>
        <programlisting language="xml"><![CDATA[  <xsl:function name="prv:isTitle1" as="xs:boolean">
    <xsl:param name="line" as="xs:string"/>
    <xsl:sequence select="$line eq '# Title 1'"/>
  </xsl:function>]]></programlisting>
      </example>
      
      <para>Now, all tests are green.</para>
      
      <para>We now can add new test cases for titles. XSpec allows to wrap scenarios into scenarios, it is
        very useful to group scenarios together ; that's what we do here, to check if our <code>isTitle1</code>
        function is correct :</para>
      
      <example>
        <title>XSpec 3</title>
        <programlisting language="xml"><![CDATA[  <x:scenario label="testing isTitle1">
    <x:scenario label="# Title 1">
      <x:call function="prv:isTitle1">
        <x:param># Title 1</x:param>
      </x:call>
      <x:expect label="true" select="true()"/>
    </x:scenario>
    <x:scenario label="# Another title 1">
      <x:call function="prv:isTitle1">
        <x:param># Another title 1</x:param>
      </x:call>
      <x:expect label="true" select="true()"/>
    </x:scenario>
  </x:scenario>]]></programlisting>
      </example>
      
      <para>The new scenario fails, our function is not correctly written. As we have read
        the Markdown specification, we know that a level 1 title must starts with <code># </code>,
        so we code this :</para>
      
      <example>
        <title>XSLT 8</title>
        <programlisting language="xml"><![CDATA[  <xsl:function name="prv:isTitle1" as="xs:boolean">
    <xsl:param name="line" as="xs:string"/>
    <xsl:sequence select="$line => starts-with('# ')"/>
  </xsl:function>]]></programlisting>
      </example>
      
      <para>And all tests succeed.</para>
        
      <para>Last, we have to test that the produced <code>title</code> element contains the correct text.
        So we write a new scenario with a different text. And we refactor scenarios titles, to be clearer :</para>
      
      <example>
        <title>XSpec 4</title>
        <programlisting language="xml"><![CDATA[  <x:scenario label="Exercise Book title">
    <x:scenario label="Title 1">
      <x:context select="'# Title 1'" mode="convert"/>
      <x:expect label="A title element with text in">
        <title>Title 1</title>
      </x:expect>
    </x:scenario>
    <x:scenario label="Another title 1">
      <x:context select="'# Another title 1'" mode="convert"/>
      <x:expect label="A title element with Another title 1 in">
        <title>Another title 1</title>
      </x:expect>
    </x:scenario>
  </x:scenario>]]></programlisting>
      </example>
      
      <para>This new scenario fails, we can correct the template to produce the expected output :</para>
      
      <example>
        <title>XSLT 9</title>
        <programlisting language="xml"><![CDATA[  <xsl:template match=".[prv:isTitle1(.)]" mode="convert" expand-text="true">
    <title>{. => substring(3)}</title>
  </xsl:template>]]></programlisting>
      </example>
      
      <para>This new code make all scenarios succeed. We are done with implementation for level 1 titles,
        but code is not very understandable : what does <code>. => substring(3)</code> mean from a business
        point of view ? Nothing, it's too technical. Let's add clarity, and extract all the thecnical code
        in a function :</para>
      
      <example>
        <title>XSLT 10</title>
        <programlisting language="xml"><![CDATA[  <xsl:function name="prv:getTitle1Content">
    <xsl:param name="line" as="xs:string"/>
    <xsl:value-of select="$line => substring(3)"/>
  </xsl:function>
  <xsl:template match=".[prv:isTitle1(.)]" mode="convert" expand-text="true">
    <title>{prv:getTitle1Content(.)}</title>
  </xsl:template>]]></programlisting>
      </example>
      
      <para>And again, move function to the bottom of file, it's only technical details... Now, if we look
        at our code, we have a template where the match attribute contains an understable business rule, and
        it produces an output that is also described by a business rule. All rules are clearly defined in the
        code. This code will be much simpler to maintain if business rules evolve in the future, and if
        developers who write the initial code are not still active on the project. We can read the code from
        top to bottom, as a book.</para>
      
      <example>

      <title>Next titles and list items</title>
      <para>Then, the same process is applied to level 2 and level 3 titles, to level 1 and
        level 2 list items. We write a new test case, we check that the test fail, we write the
        minimum code to make the test succeed, and we refactor production code to make it readable.</para>

    <title>Pro and Cons of using TDD for XSLT development</title>
    <para>When applying strictly Test Driven Development method, we only write code that is required
      by a business use case. we do not have any unnecessary code.</para>
    <para>When appying with test driven development, developers proceed by baby steps. This allows to
    focus on a simple problem, and produces simple code.</para>
    <para>Refactoring is the phase where code is reorganised. It eliminates duplication, and make appears
    design that simplifies code. Code is simplified as features are added<biblioref linkend="wycash"/></para>
    <para>Extracting code to functions allows the business requirement being exposed clearly. It also
      conduct to respect the Single Responsability Principle. Respecting the SRP makes the code more
      robust and more easy to maintain.</para>
    <para>As all business requirements are exposed as unit tests, and as the tests all succeed, there is no bug
      in code.</para>
    <para>As we write only code that is required to make a test succeed, all code is covered by unit tests.
      TDD drives us to have a 100% code coverage ; it's difficult to have such a coverage with other methods.</para>
    <para>Data coverage is more a problem. We can not write code to process unexpected or unknown data, as
      we are not able to write test cases for this unexpected data ; but we can write code that fails if there
      is an unexpected data structure.</para>
    
    <section>
      <title>Bugs</title>
      <para>When a program do not behave as expected, we call this a bug. Using TDD forces to express all expected
        behavior by tests. So all behavior is perfectly known and proven. If TDD is used, then there is no bug in
        our code.</para>
      <para>We may have new expectations. A client may ask for a new semantic, a new rendering. It's not a bug. It
        has not been expressed before, we have to implement a new behavior. We will do this by applying TDD.
        Creating new tests, implementing code to make tests succeed may drives to have existing tests that fail. We
        have to check carefully if we broke the expected behavior, or if the existing test that fail is still valid.
        Sometime, adding new features drives to change existing features, and so drives to change tests.</para>
      <para>On the OXiane Course project, we do not have any ticket that was an error, after investigation. We have
        tickets where the client says "it doesn't work as I expect". But it works as it was expected in the beginning.
        And these tickets have conduct us to change some parts of syntax, mainly on image sizing.</para>
    </section>
    
    <section>
      <title>Baby steps</title>
      <para>Coding with TDD, we should proceed by baby steps. Only small things, one by one. When this first thing works,
        then you create a second test, with a second baby step, and you code it.</para>
      <para>This allows the developer to focus on problems one by one. And not to disperse in many problems.</para>
      <para>When a bay step is coded wand when all tests succeed, we are able to deliver our code. It may be complete,
        but everything that's coded works, is documented by steps, and is reliable. We are able to deliver the final product
        to final users, and they are able to evaluate it. This ability to deliver all the time is required by agile methods.</para>
      <para>This may conduct to have a lot of corks in our production code, if developer can not find the the way to make the
        code right (Make it run, make it correct, make it fast<biblioref linkend="xp-explained"/>). But with this corks,
        the code behaves correctly, according to written unit tests. The corks will disapear in refactoring phase.</para>
    </section>
    
    <section>
      <title>Refactoring</title>
      <para>As written above, refactoring is the most important phase of TDD loop. This experience of using TDD with XSLT
        has shown that refactoring tools provided by Oxygen are limited, and they can be enhanced to provide high level
        helpers. Other IDE, like IntelliJ or Eclipse, provide very advanced refactoring tools, and this tools allows
        developpers to be much more efficient. For example, when we rename a function, all code that calls this function
        is updated to take in account the rename. But Oxygen has already this refactoring operations, some implemented
        in editor, like move XML element, which fits with slide statement<biblioref linkend="REFACTO-slide-statement"/>, some
        from the Refactoring menu. Users probably need to challenge Oxygen team to enhance these refactoring operations.</para>
      <para>Refactoring is the phase where design emerges. When we see many corks written one after the other, we see
        what we have to do to introduce the right design, or the right patterns to eliminate duplications and to simplify
        the code.</para>
    </section>
    
    <section>
      <title>Code Coverage</title>
      <para>Code coverage is a common indicator of code quality. Tools like Sonarqube have metrics on code coverage.
        Code coverage, in object oriented languages, is calculated on lines of code. But in these languages, there is
        mainly only one instruction per line of code.</para>
        <para>In XSLT, spacing in code is part of code. If we separate two sequence constructors by a space or a
          carriage return, the output is changed. And so we may have more than one instruction per line of code.
          Calculating code coverage with XSLT is more complex than with other languages.</para>
        <para>XSpec is able to calculate code coverage with XSLT. It requires to use Saxon-EE. XSpec does not provide
          a numeric result for code coverage, but there is a colored rendering of XSLT code that allows to know if a code
          instruction is tested or not. Since Saxon 10, API has changed and XSpec framework has not been fully updated for
          these API changes. Michael Kay (Saxonica) has contributed to XSpec framework to correct this, but there is still
          some job to do to have good results on code coverage evaluation. If we keep a line scope for coverage, and if we
          are able to ignore XML vocabulary like namespace declarations, then we can see that all the XSLT code is covered
          by unit tests.</para>
    </section>
    
    <section>
      <title>Data Coverage</title>
      <para>Data coverage is another important quality indicator. We have to be sure that our code covers all data cases.
        As XSLT is a data-driven process, there are some mechanisms in XSLT to ensure that all data cases are processed,
        like <code>no-match</code> attributes in <code>xsl:mode</code>. But it is sometime not enough, as we can decide
        to process only parts of input content, with <code>xsl:apply-templates/@select</code> for examples.</para>
      <para>A common way to ensure that all data cases are covered is to use grammars on input content.
        XML Schema<biblioref linkend="xml-schema"/>, RelaxNG<biblioref linkend="relaxng"/> and Schematron<biblioref linkend="schematron"/>
        are commons grammars used with XML content, and at least XML Schema and Schematron can easily be embeded in an XSLT
        transformation. But in our case, input is pure text, with no markup, and these grammars are not made to validate text.</para>  
      <para>Today, we are only 6 people to use this tool, and we decided to ignore data coverage problems. If a writer use
        an unsupported syntax, it is simply processed as simple text, and sent to output without any transform. It is neither
        satisfying nor robust, but, at this point of usability, we will not invest more in this part.</para>

    <title>Conclusion</title>

    <para>Test Driven Development, Refactoring, Clean Code and Software Craftsmanship are all techniques and methods that produces
      high quality code in Oriented-Object Programming languages.</para>
    <para>XSpec framework, and its integration in Oxygen, allows to apply test driven development with XSLT. It runs quickly enough
      to have a short TDD loop, and to produce quickly deliverable code.</para>
    <para>Coding time is a little it more important than with standard method, but it produces code that is much cheaper to maintain,
      and much more reliable.</para>
    <para>Mixing TDD and XSLT provides a lot of serinity to developers.</para>
