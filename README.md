# README for MUK Proceedings

This contains the code for the Markup UK Proceedings, including a couple of files that customise a modified v 1.79 of the DocBook XSLT 1.0 stylesheets.

## Working on the 'muk2019' branch

### Getting the code

1. Fork the `MarkupUK/MUK-proc` repository on GitHub
1. Clone your fork to your computer:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/MUK-proc.git
   ```
1. Change directory to the new clone:
   ```
   cd MUK-proc
   ```
1. Checkout the `muk2019` branch:
   ```
   git checkout muk2019
   ```
1. Pull both the `muk2019` branch and the `MUK-xsl` submodule that it uses:
   ```
   git pull --recurse-submodules origin muk2019
   ```
1. Format the proceedings and/or make changes to the XML and XSLT

### Formatting the proceedings

Automated formatting requires Apache Ant and AH Formatter.

1. Check that the properties defined in `properties.xml` are correct for your installation.
 - If a property needs to be changed for everyone, edit `properties.xml` and then commit your changes
 - If a property, such as for the location of a file, needs to be changed only for your installation, copy `properties.xml` to `properties.local.xml` and edit that file so that it contains only your property overrides. The definitions in `properties.local.xml` (if it exists) have precedence over the properties in `properties.xml` because Ant reads `properties.local.xml` before `properties.xml`.
1. Run Ant:
   ```
   ant -emacs
   ```
   If Ant skips stages because it isn't detecting changes in your files, force all stages to run:
   ```
   ant -emacs -Dforce=yes
   ```

### Submitting changes to the `muk2019` branch

When you have changes that are *not* in the `xsl` subdirectory:

1. Make sure that your repository is up to date with `MarkupUK/MUK-proc`:
   1. Add `MarkupUK/MUK-proc` as a remote repository:
      ```
	  git remote add upstream https://github.com/MarkupUK/MUK-proc.git
	  ```
   1. Check that it worked:
      ```
	  git remote -v
	  ```
   1. Merge upstream changes into your fork:
	  ```
	  git rebase upstream/muk2019
	  ```
   1. Push any upstream changes to your fork on GitHub:
      ```
	  git push origin muk2019
	  ```
1. Create a new branch for your changes:
   ```
   git checkout -b my-new-branch
   ```
1. Make your changes (if they haven't been made already)
1. Review your changes:
   ```
   git diff
   ```
1. Commit your changes; for example:
   ```
   git add README.md
   git commit -m"Instructions for making changes."
   ```
1. Push your commits to your repository on GitHub:
   ```
   git push -u origin my-new-branch
   ```
1. On GitHub, make a pull request to merge your changes in `my-new-branch` into the `muk2019` branch of `MarkupUK/MUK-proc`

### Submitting changes in the `xsl` directory

That's a whole different kettle of fish...
