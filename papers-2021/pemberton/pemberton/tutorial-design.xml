    <title>Tutorials</title>
    <para>
      A tutorial is a challenging educational setting, both for those
      learning and those instructing. Time is severely limited, and
      there is inevitably far more material on the subject than can
      possibly be taught in the time available. Unavoidably, compromises
      have to be made: do you make it deep and narrow, where you learn a
      subset of the material in great detail, or broad and shallow,
      where you get an overview of the whole, with less detail? Should
      it be a teaser to tempt attendees to later self-study, or a
      starter, so that attendees have at least a working knowledge of
      some of the material?
    </para>
    <para>
      And then there is the method of presentation: should it be lecture
      style, permitting coverage of more of the material, or hands-on,
      allowing attendees more direct acquaintance with the material,
      while reducing the coverage?
    </para>
    <section xml:id="xforms-tutorials">
      <title>XForms Tutorials</title>
      <para>
        Most XForms tutorials [e.g. <link linkend="t1">t1</link>,
        <link linkend="t2">t2</link>] had to-date been of the lecture
        style, covering most of the language. However, a request for a
        hands-on tutorial motivated a new approach.
      </para>
      <para>
        After attending several hands-on tutorials on other topics, the
        author concluded that in order to optimally use the time
        available for exercises, attendees shouldn't be required to
        start from scratch, since precious time is lost dealing with
        trivial issues like set up and syntax. Rather, the exercises
        should all require the attendee to make a change to an existing,
        working, example, using the newly-acquired knowledge. In that
        way, you get the advantage of the hands-on approach, while
        minimising trivial administrative details, with the added
        advantage of attendees being confronted with larger working
        examples right from the start.
      </para>
      <para>
        As a consequence, the tutorial was designed as a rapid-fire
        sequence of exercises, each consisting of 5 minutes of
        presentation, followed by 5 minutes of coding. This has the
        added advantage of maximising the attendees' concentration,
        thanks to the recurrent switching of activities. The exercises
        themselves are mostly not stand-alone, but cumulative, each one
        building on an earlier one, so that at the end the attendee has
        a handful of small, but in themselves useful, applications.
        Although the tutorial was designed to be part of a live event,
        it also supports the use of self-study.
      </para>
      <para>
        The resulting tutorial [<link linkend="t3">t3</link>] is
        interesting in that it is not only <emphasis>about</emphasis>
        XForms, but is also built <emphasis>in</emphasis> XForms, which
        in itself gave surprising possibilities.
      </para>
    </section>

  <section xml:id="content">
    <title>Content</title>
    <para>
      The first task in designing a tutorial is to identify the topics
      to be taught. This was a fairly easy job in this case, since it
      only involved running through the headings of the XForms
      specification, and selecting topics. Naturally enough, a
      structured XML document listing those topics, and their relative
      structure was created as part of this process:
    </para>
    <programlisting>
&lt;learn title=&quot;What you will learn&quot;&gt;
   &lt;topic name=&quot;Structure of an XForm&quot;&gt;
      &lt;topic done=&quot;&quot; name=&quot;&amp;lt;model&gt;&quot;/&gt;
      &lt;topic done=&quot;&quot; name=&quot;content&quot;/&gt;
   &lt;/topic&gt;
   &lt;topic name=&quot;Instance data&quot;&gt;
      &lt;topic done=&quot;&quot; name=&quot;internal &amp;lt;instance&gt;&quot;/&gt;
      &lt;topic done=&quot;&quot; name=&quot;external &amp;lt;instance @resource&gt;&quot;/&gt;
      &lt;topic done=&quot;&quot; name=&quot;&amp;lt;bind&gt;&quot;&gt;
     &lt;topic done=&quot;&quot; name=&quot;@ref&quot;/&gt;
     &lt;topic done=&quot;&quot; name=&quot;@type&quot;/&gt;
     &lt;topic done=&quot;&quot; name=&quot;@calculate&quot;/&gt;
     &lt;topic done=&quot;&quot; name=&quot;@relevant&quot;/&gt;
     &lt;topic done=&quot;&quot; name=&quot;@required&quot;/&gt;
     &lt;topic done=&quot;&quot; name=&quot;@readonly&quot;/&gt;
     &lt;topic done=&quot;&quot; name=&quot;@constraint&quot;/&gt;
      &lt;/topic&gt;
   &lt;/topic&gt;
   ...
</programlisting>
    <para>
      In fact this one document ended up being used in three ways:
      firstly and primarily as the list of topics that needed to be
      covered, that could then be checked off one by one as the tutorial
      was written, as a check for completeness. But additionally it
      ended up displayed in two different ways in the tutorial itself:
      once at the beginning as an overview of what would be taught in
      the course, and again at the end of the course, though displayed
      in a different way, as a summary of what had been taught, allowing
      the reader to check each topic off as a reminder of what had been
      learned (a correspondent had indicated that tutorials that
      included such a check-list on average were evaluated by attendees
      10% higher). In fact this last section, allowing the attendee to
      check off topics learned, was the first written, so that as the
      tutorial was developed, the topics could be checked off.
    </para>
    <para>
      The next step is to decide the <emphasis>order</emphasis> these
      topics need to be taught. This was done by creating a dependency
      graph: to understand this topic, you need to know about these
      topics, to understand <emphasis>those</emphasis> topics, you need
      to know about these other topics, and so on. This gives a partial
      ordering of topics, which can then be ordered linearly at will.
    </para>
    <para>
      For example, to understand the <literal>alert</literal> element,
      you need to know about validity; to understand validity, you need
      to know about <literal>type</literal>,
      <literal>constraint</literal>, and <literal>required</literal>, to
      know about those, you need to know about <literal>bind</literal>,
      and <literal>ref</literal>, to know about those you need to know
      about <literal>instance</literal>.
      <figure>
	 <title>A simplified partial dependency graph</title>
        <imageobject>
          <imagedata fileref="dependency.png" />
        </imageobject>
      </figure>
    </para>
    <para>
      It is worth pointing out that there is some leeway in even the
      partial ordering that the dependency graph generates, because
      rather than completely covering all the  antecedents of a topic
      first, you can use progressive disclosure
      [<link linkend="pd">pd</link>]; for instance you could partially
      cover validity, talking only about types, and then extend it later
      with constraints and <literal>required</literal>. What the graph
      does reveal though is the order the partial disclosure has to
      happen.
    </para>
    <para>
      This then leads to a fundamental decision: should the topics be
      taught top-down, or bottom-up? Bottom-up starts at the leaves of
      the dependency graph and works upwards building higher
      abstractions out of the lower-level ones; top-down works in the
      other direction, starting with the high-level abstractions, and
      working down towards the leaves. I am not aware of studies of the
      relative effectiveness of the two methods, nor whether one is more
      effective than the other with certain types of audience. I
      personally believe, based on experience of teaching, that top-down
      works better in general, especially with knowledgeable audiences,
      since it gives more opportunity to see the wood for the trees:
      each new thing you learn, you understand how it fits in the larger
      picture.
    </para>
  </section>
  <section xml:id="structure">
    <title>Structure</title>
    <para>
      The topics were largely treated one per chapter, and in general
      written in the order they would be presented. It was attempted to
      make each chapter not more than one screen-full long, around 50-60
      lines of text, followed by its exercise.
    </para>
    <para>
      Each chapter was built as a single XHTML+XForms document; if it
      became too long, it could be split into two chapters;
      occasionally, if a chapter was very short, or if context demanded
      it, two concepts would be covered in a single chapter.
    </para>
    <para>
      An XML document was kept as chapters were written documenting the
      title, filename, concepts covered, name of the exercise file, and
      name of the example answer file:
    </para>

  </section>
  <section xml:id="navigation">
    <title>Navigation</title>
    <para>
      This document of chapters was then used as the basis of the
      navigation part of the tutorial. This was modelled on the
      navigation used in an earlier XForms application, the XForms 2.0
      test suite [<link linkend="ts">ts</link>].
    </para>
    <para>
      A navigation instance was created containing
    </para>
    <orderedlist spacing="compact">
      <listitem>
        <para>
          a value <literal>base</literal> that defines where the chapter
          files are stored,
        </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          a value for the filename of the chapter that is currently
          being read,
        </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          a value that constructs the required URL from the base and the
          filename:
        </para>
      </listitem>
    </orderedlist>
    <programlisting>
&lt;instance id=&quot;nav&quot;&gt;
   &lt;nav xmlns=&quot;&quot;&gt;
      &lt;base&gt;chapters/&lt;/base&gt;
      &lt;file/&gt;
      &lt;url/&gt;
   &lt;/nav&gt;
&lt;/instance&gt;
&lt;bind ref=&quot;instance('nav')/url&quot; calculate=&quot;concat(../base, ../file)&quot;/&gt;
</programlisting>
    <para>
      To set the filename, a <literal>select1</literal> control is
      populated using the tutorial chapters instance: the labels are the
      title of the chapter, and the value is the file name of that
      chapter:
    </para>
    <programlisting>
&lt;select1 ref=&quot;instance('nav')/file&quot;&gt;
   &lt;itemset ref=&quot;instance('tut')/entry&quot;&gt;
       &lt;label ref=&quot;title&quot;/&gt;
       &lt;value value=&quot;file&quot;/&gt;
   &lt;/itemset&gt;
&lt;/select1&gt;
</programlisting>
    <para>
      Either side of this control, are triggers that decrement and
      increment this value (with judicious use of
      <literal>preceding-sibling</literal> and
      <literal>following-sibling</literal>):
    </para>
    <programlisting>
&lt;trigger 
      ref=&quot;instance('tut')/entry[file=instance('nav')/file]/preceding-sibling::entry[1]&quot;&gt;
   &lt;label&gt;←&lt;/label&gt;
   &lt;hint&gt;&lt;output ref=&quot;title&quot;/&gt;&lt;/hint&gt;
   &lt;setvalue ref=&quot;instance('nav')/file&quot;
             value=&quot;context()/file&quot;
             ev:event=&quot;DOMActivate&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/trigger&gt;
</programlisting>
    <para>
      In this way, the user can select a chapter either from the drop
      down, or by navigating from chapter to chapter using the arrows.

      </screenshot>
    </para>
    <para>
      Note that thanks to how the <literal>ref</literal> on the trigger
      works in XForms, in this case referencing the previous chapter, if
      there is no previous chapter, the trigger will not be displayed.

    </para>
    <para>
      To display the content of the chapter, an html iframe is used:
    </para>
    <programlisting>
&lt;html:iframe id=&quot;chapter&quot; src=&quot;{instance('nav')/url}&quot;&gt;&lt;/html:iframe&gt;
</programlisting>
    <para>
      Thanks to how XForms works, whenever the <literal>file</literal>
      value gets changed, the <literal>url</literal> value automatically
      gets updated, and so the new chapter is displayed.
    </para>
    <para>
      The upshot of all this is that the tutorial instance doesn't
      <emphasis>describe</emphasis> the structure of the tutorial but
      actually <emphasis>defines</emphasis> it. If a chapter needs to be
      moved, you just move it in the tutorial instance; if a new chapter
      is written, add it to the tutorial document. The navigation will
      consequently automatically be updated, and the chapter can be
      displayed.
    </para>
  </section>
  <section xml:id="chapters">
    <title>Chapters</title>
    <para>
      Each chapter is thus a separate XForms document. This has amazing
      advantages when talking about XForms, because the text can
      actually contain the examples it is describing, rather than
      descriptions of the expected output.
    </para>
    <para>
      For example, if a chapter contains the text:
    </para>
    <informalexample>
      <para>
        By default, outputs directly after each other will abut. If a is
        3, and b is 4, then
      </para>
      <programlisting>
&lt;output ref=&quot;a&quot;/&gt;&lt;output ref=&quot;b&quot;/&gt;
</programlisting>
      <para>
        will output:
      </para>
      <programlisting>
34
</programlisting>
    </informalexample>
    <para>
      the underlying code is:
    </para>
    <programlisting>
By default, outputs directly after each other will abut.
If a is &lt;output  ref=&quot;a&quot;/&gt;, and b is &lt;output ref=&quot;b&quot;/&gt;, then
&lt;group class=&quot;pre&quot;&gt;
   &amp;lt;output ref=&quot;a&quot;/&gt;&amp;lt;output ref=&quot;b&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/group&gt;
will output:
&lt;group class=&quot;pre&quot;&gt;
   &lt;output ref=&quot;a&quot;/&gt;&lt;output ref=&quot;b&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/group&gt;
</programlisting>
    <para>
      In other words a really <emphasis>is</emphasis> 3, and b really
      <emphasis>is</emphasis> 4, and the example output is produced by
      the code itself.
    </para>
    <para>
      This of course has immense advantage: you make fewer mistakes, you
      can put decisions off, or make changes easily without worrying
      about consistency between text and results.
    </para>
  </section>
  <section xml:id="exercises">
    <title>Exercises</title>
    <para>
      The exercises are based on 5 example applications: a short initial
      'toy' one covering two exercises introducing the basic concepts
      such as instances, types, input and output, and then two large
      ones each covering 10 exercises, both broken in the middle by two
      small examples. The large examples helped with ordering the
      partial order of the material, since concepts could be introduced
      as they were needed for enlarging the functionality of the
      applications.
    </para>
    <para>
      The first large example introduces external instances loaded over
      the internet, in this case the exchange values of a large number
      of currencies, and builds an application to display the exchange
      rate between two currencies of choice.
    </para>
    <para>
      It is broken in the middle with a small application to show how
      times are manipulated, and to introduce the concept of events.
    </para>
    <para>
      Submission is then introduced to show how to to load new
      instances, and how to deal with submission errors, and then how to
      generate a URL for use in submission.
    </para>
    <para>
      The second application is a to-do list, in order to show how to
      manipulate lists, how to use submission to save data, how to
      detect when data needs saving, and finally how to automatically
      save data when it has changed.
    </para>
    <para>
      It is broken in the middle with a small log-in application, that
      shows how to input passwords, and how to deal with validity
      errors.
    </para>
    <para>
      In some senses, finding suitable examples that were expandable in
      this way, gradually adding new concepts as they were needed was
      the hardest part of designing the tutorial. It is easy to create
      one tiny toy example for each concept being taught, but more work
      to design ones that are meaningful and useful applications that
      have the right collection of necessary concepts.
    </para>

  <section xml:id="server">
    <title>Server</title>
    <para>
      One of the requirements for following the tutorial is that the
      user have access to an HTTP server, and furthermore, one that
      supports the PUT method [<link linkend="put">put</link>], since
      several of the exercises use it. For reasons that are not entirely
      clear, most HTTP servers available don't support PUT at all, or
      otherwise only with a lot of extra work. So the options for the
      tutorial apparently are: require the attendees to locate and
      install an existing server that accepts PUT; run a server and then
      require anybody who wants to use the tutorial to acquire a
      username and login for it; or supply a minimal server that the
      user can easily install and use. We opted for the third.
    </para>
    <para>
      Luckily, writing a simple server without the normal
      industrial-strength requirements of large-scale servers is fairly
      easy, and since we had already written one for the XForms Test
      Suite [<link linkend="ts">ts</link>], XContents
      [<link linkend="xc">xc</link>], we used that, a few hundred lines
      of C code, which we then compiled for a number of standard
      platforms. Unfortunately, during testing, we discovered that on
      Windows, one virus scanner falsely identified the server as
      malware, and so for the people who ran against that problem we
      also wrote a JavaScript version which runs under Node.
    </para>
    <para>
      Since the tutorial demands a server that uses PUT, the tutorial
      itself could use it for its own purposes. In particular whenever
      the user navigates to a new chapter, the current state is saved so
      that should the user stop and log out, on return the tutorial is
      restarted at the last-used location.
    </para>

  <section xml:id="experience">
    <title>Experience</title>
    <para>
      At the time of writing, the tutorial has been given once, not
      counting a couple of try-outs with single victims.
    </para>
    <para>
      With only 2 hours allocated, and each exercise being budgeted for
      5 minutes presentation and 5 minutes working, only 12 of the 25
      sections were handled. Nevertheless, this wasn't seen as a
      problem, since the tutorial is also designed for self-study, and
      so the attendees could do the rest of the tutorial at their
      leisure.
    </para>
    <para>
      There is a problem with doing a tutorial remotely, as was the
      case, that there is far less contact with the individual
      attendees, in order to solve problems, and less opportunity to
      assess if people have properly finished an exercise, especially
      since later exercises use the results of previous exercises. In
      fact this could be seen as a disadvantage of the cumulative
      approach to the exercises, in that it requires previous exercises
      to be completed before you can continue.
    </para>
    <para>
      The tutorial was well-received; it revealed a few places where the
      exposition could be clarified, but otherwise went well.
    </para>

    <title>Conclusion</title>
    <para>
       Tutorial design, like any curriculum design, is hard! It is a
       surprising amount of work, with a lot of internal
       dependencies. However I have to admit that writing this one was
       a lot of fun, being about and in XForms allowed me to submerge
       myself fully in the subject, and allowed a lot of the internal
       dependencies to take care of themselves. Using XForms for the
       navigation introduced a large amount of flexibility in the
       construction of the tutorial.
