            <para>CSS Within is a new way to integrate CSS generation with HTML
                generation to help reduce or eliminate these problems.</para>
            <para>The method used is to embed rule and media elements, in a CSS
                Within namespace, inside XSLT templates. This puts the CSS
                styles exactly where the XSLT developer needs them: right next
                to the XSLT instructions producing the elements that they
                style.</para>
            <para>Limited usage experience suggests that CSS Within makes HTML

        <title>Introduction</title>
        <para>A common problem when using XSLT to make HTML and CSS is keeping
            the XSLT, HTML and CSS synchronized. Changes to the XSLT that affect
            what HTML is generated necessitate corresponding changes to CSS;
            changes to the CSS may necessitate changes to the XSLT. Over time
            there will be some elements in the HTML for which there is no style
            information in the CSS, or for which the style information is out of
            date; there will be rules in the CSS that are no longer needed, or,
            worse, that are out of date and are only sometimes triggered.</para>
        <para>Generating CSS from within XSLT, perhaps with one large xsl:text
            element, helps to reduce the divergence by making it easier to find
            CSS rules that affect a given element. But it is still easy to
            forget to update the CSS. A search for div.beer might not show up
            anything, but the CSS might have a selector <code>fridge>*</code>
            which matches beer (or any other element) when it's in the fridge.
            So it is not always trivial to locate the appropriate CSS rule to
            update.</para>
        <para>With XSLT 3 also comes expand-text="yes" and curly braces being
            potentially special inside text node constructors, conflicting with
            CSS syntax.</para>
        <para>CSS Within supports multiple stylesheets (for example for Web and
            PDF), and can run in pure XSLT or with extension instructions
            currently available for Saxon, in Java). Limited usage experience
            suggests that CSS Within makes HTML generation easier to maintain
            and more robust over time.  This paper describes how to use CSS
            Within in your own projects and also discusses the current
            implementations and their limitations.</para>
    </sect1>
    <sect1>
        <title>Rules and Media</title>
        <para>CSS Within introduces <code>css:rule</code> and
                <code>css:media</code> elements into XSLT stylesheets. We will
            begin by looking at <code>css:rule</code> since it is the
            fundamental building block both of CSS Within and, indirectly, of
            CSS itself.</para>
        <para>Consider an XSLT template as follows:</para>
        <programlisting language="xml">&lt;xsl:template match="products-found">
    &lt;!--* match search results, if any *-->
    &lt;div class="productlist">
        &lt;xsl:on-non-empty>
            &lt;h3>Products&lt;/h3>
        &lt;/xsl:on-non-empty>
        &lt;xsl:apply-templates/>
        &lt;xsl:on-empty>
            &lt;p class="no-products">
               No products matched your irritating query. Go away.
            &lt;/p>
        &lt;/xsl:on-empty>
    &lt;div>
&lt;/xsl:template></programlisting>
        <para>Styling the <emphasis>Products</emphasis> heading might require
            CSS like the following:</para>
        <programlisting language="css">div.productlist {
    border: 1px solid grey;
    padding: 1rem;
}
div.productlist>h3 {
    font-family: "Bland Sans", sans;
    border-top: 1px dotted grey;
}</programlisting>
        <para>This CSS fragment consists of two rules, each consisting of a
                <emphasis>selector</emphasis> followed by a group of rules
            contained within <code>{</code> curly brackets <code>}</code>.  The
            first rule has a selector that says the rule applies  to any
                <code>div</code>element whose <code>class</code> attribute
            contains the token <code>productlist</code>. The second rule has a
            selector that applies to every <code>h3</code> element whose
            immediate parent is such a <code>div</code> element. Assuming no
            other more specific or subsequent rule overrides these, the rules
            assign values  to various CSS properties such as
                <code>padding</code>  and <code>font-family</code>. Beyond this,
            the details of CSS are not important to CSS  Within. However, it
                <emphasis>is</emphasis> worth noting that CSS uses a text-based
            non-XML syntax with which people who work with Web development are
            very familiar.</para>
        <para>It is clear from this example that the link between the
            stylesheets and the HTML being constructed is fragile: if the
            generated element structure is changed, or the class names are
            updated, the original CSS selectors will no longer match. One way to
            mitigate this is to put the CSS rules right next to the place where
            the elements they govern are generated. To put the CSS
                <emphasis>within</emphasis> the template, we might combine them
            as follows:</para>
        <programlisting language="xml">&lt;xsl:template match="products-found">
    &lt;!--* match search results, if any *-->
    &lt;div class="productlist">
        &lt;css:rule match="div.productlist">
            border: 1px solid grey;
            padding: 1rem;
        &lt;/css:rule>
        &lt;xsl:on-non-empty>
            &lt;css:rule match="div.productlist>h3">
                font-family: "Bland Sans", sans;
                border-top: 1px dotted grey;
            &lt;/css:rule>
            &lt;h3>Products&lt;/h3>
        &lt;/xsl:on-non-empty>
        &lt;xsl:apply-templates/>
        &lt;xsl:on-empty>
            &lt;p class="no-products">
               No products matched your irritating query. Go away.
            &lt;/p>
        &lt;/xsl:on-empty>
    &lt;div>
&lt;/xsl:template></programlisting>
        <para>The CSS Within tool set includes XSLT that will read the
            stylesheet itself, extract all of the <code>css:rule</code> elements
            and write a CSS stylesheet file. In this case the CSS will be
            identical to that shown above.</para>
        <para>What have we gained? First, we no longer have a conflict of
            syntax:  there are no more curly braces and everything is in XML.
            Second, the CSS definitions are right next to the elements they
            style. It is easy to imagine changing the <code>h3</code> to an
                <code>h4</code> but forgetting to change the CSS file; even if
            we remember, we then have to open the CCSS file and
                <emphasis>find</emphasis> the right rule to change. But now  the
            styles and the markup are in the same place we are likely to
            remember and, remembering, will of course find it easy to locate the
            style rule to update.</para>
        <para>Sometimes you may generate the same structure from multiple places
            in your stylesheet, but of course you don't want to repeat the CSS
            rules in the generated  stylesheet. In this case you can use an
            empty <code>css:rule</code> element  and give it a <code>ref</code>
            attribute whose value matches the <code>name</code> attribute of
            another <code>css:rule</code> element. The <code>name</code>
            attribute on the <code>css:rule</code> element also serves as a
            reminder that the style might be used elsewhere, helping to avoid
            the situation where you accidentally delete a rule you thought you
            no longer needed.</para>
        <para>If you are using CSS for both print and screen, or if you have
            stylesheets loaded only conditionally based on a media query (for
            example, containing extra rules for wide screens or overriding
            defaults set for circular displays such as on some wristwatches),
            you may well need to write out more than one CSS file with XSLT. In
            this case you can give <code>css:rule</code> elements a
                <code>stream</code> attribute, and the contents will only be
            included in the CSS ruleset you name. That way all the styles to do
            with a given output element are together and as easy as possible to
            update together, even if they are written out separately.</para>
        <para>The way the CSS is written to files is described in a subsequent
            section in this paper.</para>
        <para>If you have  media queries in your stylesheet, you can use
                <code>css:media</code> elements to generate them; these elements
            contain <code>css:rule</code> elements:</para>
        <programlisting language="xml">&lt;css:media when="min-width: 600px">
    &lt;css:rule match="ul.letterindex">
        column-count: 2;
    &lt;/css:rule>
&lt;/css:media>
&lt;css:media when="min-width: 800px">
    &lt;css:rule match="ul.letterindex">
        column-count: 3;
    &lt;/css:rule>
&lt;/css:media>
</programlisting>

        <title>The CSS Output</title>
        <para>Alongside the generated HTML one needs of course to produce CSS.
            Current Web practice is to use a mixture of separately-served CSS
            resources and CSS styles embedded within HTML itself. The primary
            tradeoff between using separate files and embedding is in bandwidth
            consumption when users visit multiple pages on the same site, or
            even the same page multiple times: a separate CSS file can then
            provide clear savings in bandwidth and in time to render the Web
            page. For the first time that a client loads a page, however,
            embedded styles for the first few elements that will be rendered on
            the page can reduce the time before the user can use the Web page.
            CSS styles embedded in HTML after the head, however, raise security
            questions outside the scope of this paper; we shall focus only on a
            separate CSS resource, created on the server as a standalone
            file.</para>
        <para>In an XSLT stylesheet using CSS Within, you can call the
                <code>css:gather</code> template to produce the CSS; use this
            within an <code>xsl:result-document</code> element  with
                <code>method="text"</code>. In the future there may instead be a
                <code>css:stream</code> element for this purpose.</para>
        <sect2>
            <title>The stream attribute</title>
            <para>If you are writing to multiple CSS files, you can give each
                    <code>css:rule</code> or <code>css:media</code> element a
                    <code>stream</code> attribute; the value of this attribute
                can be <code>#all</code> or a space-separated list of
                identifiers (as for the HTML <code>class</code> attribute); the
                corresponding CSS rules are generated to replace a
                    <code>css:stream</code> element having a <code>name</code>
                attribute with the same value; the stream name can also be
                passed as a parameter to the <code>css:gather</code> template
                which gathers the styles from where they occur in the stylesheet
                into one place. This is not currently implemented, but is
                planned.</para>
        </sect2>
    </sect1>
    <sect1>
        <title>Phases of Operation</title>
        <para>When you run an XSLT processor on a stylesheet using CSS Within,
            the following operations must occur:</para>
        <orderedlist>
            <listitem>
                <para>By default, <code>css:rule</code> elements are
                        <emphasis>literal  element constructors</emphasis>,
                    meaning that your output will be littered with CSS. So this
                    must be prevented;</para>
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
                <para>Your stylesheet must be analyzed and all of the CSS
                    elements gathered up into one or more CSS files.</para>
            </listitem>
        </orderedlist>
        <sect2>
            <title>Phase One: De-cluttering the Output</title>
            <para>The first of these two phases can happen in one of there
                ways:</para>
            <orderedlist>
                <listitem>
                    <para>By pre-processing the stylesheet to make a copy
                        without any <code>css:rule</code> r other CSS Within
                        elements that would cause problems;</para>
                </listitem>
                <listitem>
                    <para>By post-processing the generated HTML to remove the
                            <code>css:rule</code> elements that were spuriously
                        generated;</para>
                </listitem>
                <listitem>
                    <para>By modifying the XSLT processor so that it ignores the
                        content of <code>css:rule</code> elements.</para>
                </listitem>
            </orderedlist>
            <para>The first option is easily done using
                    <code>fn:transform()</code> and wrapper XSLT, although care
                must be taken to pass on any stylesheet parameters. However, it
                is not possible in general, because of stylesheet imports that
                might be conditional (depending on <code>use-when</code>
                expressions or XSLT 3 shadow attributes, for example), and
                because package import resolution happens dynamically.</para>
            <para>The second option can however be done with
                    <code>fn:transform()</code>, since the output  documents
                generated by any <code>xsl:result-document</code> elements in
                the transform are not written out but are included in the map
                returned by  <code>fn:transform()</code> and can be
                post-processed.</para>
            <para>The author of this paper wrote both XSLT for option (2) and
                also a Java class that implements XSLT extension elements for
                Saxon which make <code>css:rule</code> and
                    <code>css:media</code> simply return the empty sequence when
                the stylesheet is executed.</para>
        </sect2>
        <sect2>
            <title>Phase Two: Writing Out the CSS</title>
            <para>Again there are multiple approaches to finding all of the CSS
                elements and writing out the stylesheets. It is important that
                    <emphasis>all</emphasis> of the styles are written, even if
                they are inside templates that were not matched, as they might
                be styles for dynamically generated content. However, because a
                stylesheet can be compiled, saved in compiled form, and executed
                at a later time, we cannot write a Java extension that saves all
                of the <code>css:rule</code> and <code>css:media</code> at
                compile-time in a singleton object that can then be returned by
                a <code>css:stream</code> instruction.</para>
            <para>Currently, extraction of CSS styles is done with XSLT, and
                does not work with dynamic import or package selection. So far
                this has not been a problem in practice, and ongoing experiments
                with package conventions may in time provide a solution.</para>
            <para>An approach using a template in each separate file or package
                that matches <code>css:gather</code> elements and then calls
                    <code>xsl:next-match</code> seems very promising.</para>
        </sect2>
    </sect1>
    <sect1>
        <title>Pure XSLT Implementation</title>
        <para>The pure XSLT implementation of CSS Within uses
                <code>fn:transform</code> to run the original transformation and
            post-processes the result to remove unwanted CSS Within elements. It
            then processes the stylesheet files themselves as XML documents to
            find all of the <code>css:rule</code> and <code>css:media</code>
            elements and construct stylesheets.</para>
        <para>This approach does not work with separate compilation, as in that
            case the source code for the original transformation is no longer
            available. It  also  does not  work with packages, since the package
            location mechanism is not visible at the XSLT level. However, it is
            still very useful.</para>
    </sect1>
    <sect1>
        <title>Java Extension for Saxon</title>
        <para>CSS Within currently  includes a Java definition of XSLT extension
            elements for <code>css:rule</code> and <code>css:media</code> that
            simply return an empty sequence at compile time. When the stylesheet
            runs, the CSS Within elements are gone, so there is no need for a
            clean-up phase.</para>
        <para>In development is an extension element for <code>css:gather</code>
            which at stylesheet compilation builds the CSS stylesheet so that
            when run, the <code>css:gather</code> element is replaced by an
                <code>xsl:text</code> element containing the text of the
            stylesheet. In order that the CSS fragments are collected from
            included and imported stylesheets and packages,
                <code>apply-templates</code> must be called in
                <code>css:gather</code> mode; the CSS Within stylesheet which
            can be imported contains a template that uses
                <code>xsl:next-match</code> to fetch the <code>css:gather</code>
            fragments from every other stylesheet module. Since all of this is
            arranged when the stylesheet is compiled, run-time support for the
            extension elements is not required. Each module must either include
            the CSS Within stylesheet, or must define a suitable
                <code>css:gather</code> template.</para>
        <para>This <code>css:gather</code> implementation is then used by the
            public <code>css:stream</code> element to  produce the text of the
            CSS stylesheet.</para>
        <para>The complexities of configuring Saxon to run an extension, and of
            supporting separate compilation where the runtime engine is not
            necessarily in the same Java instance as the execution, or even in

        <title>Discussion: Deployment</title>
        <para>An unexpected benefit of having CSS inside XSLT templates is that
            you can copy snippets of XSLT from one project to another, perhaps
            to implement Web-page controls or other common functionality, and
            the style is carried with them too. You could also do this if you
            had the CSS <emphasis>before</emphasis> the individual XSLT
            templates instead of inside them, but in that case you would have
            the possibility of missing the styles for the first template, and
            either the template would be separated from any <code>xd:doc</code>
            elements preceding it, or the CSS would be before the
                <code>xd:doc</code> elements and hence separated too far from
            the body of the template to reap the benefits of CSS Within.</para>
        <para>The CSS Within approach relies on the CSS cascade mechanism: it is
            because of this that is not necessary to specify full styles for
            each generated element. This also means that a generated element
            that can appear in multiple contexts may need multiple
                <code>css:rule</code>elements for the different contexts. As an
            alternative, the base styles can be placed in the template
            generating the ancestor element, and this relationship can be made
            specific with a <code>ref=</code> attribute on the individual
                <code>css:rule</code> elements to show the dependency. This
            makes no difference to the generated CSS, but helps the human
            maintainer of the stylesheet understand what has been done and keep
            it up to date. The XSLT implementation does currently check the
                <code>ref</code> attributes.</para>

        <title>Limitations</title>
        <para>Currently, the CSS Within implementations support neither separate
            compilation nor packages. This work is in progress at the time of
            writing this paper (April 2021).</para>
        <para>Since there is no support yet for CSS at-rules such as
                <code>@font</code>, all such constructs must be placed in the
            header part of the CSS stylesheet. This precludes, for example,
            having differing font-face rules based on media queries (or
            complicates it). An alternative design was explored that involved
            giving <code>css:rule</code> elements attributes with the same names
            as CSS properties, such as <code>font-family='"Times Roman",
                "times", serif'</code>; this took CSS  Within too far away from
            CSS syntax.</para>
        <para>The CSS stylesheet is constructed from all of the
                <code>css:rule</code> and <code>css:media</code> elements in the
            order in which they occur in the stylesheet; there is no control
            over the ordering. It is not clear yet whether this is
            needed.</para>
        <para>Finally, it is worth noting that CSS Within has only been use in
            single-person projects so far. Although the author took some trouble
            to keep the body of <code>css:rule</code> and <code>css:media</code>
            as plain text in CSS syntax, so that one can be in, so to speak, a
            CSS state of mind when reviewing the styles, the method has not been
            tested with different people working on CSS and on XSLT.</para>
    </sect1>
    <sect1>
        <title>Future Work</title>
        <para>Future work for CSS Within includes supporting more of CSS; today
            you can have a header, individual rules, and a footer; the header
            might for example define Web font rules. Adding more elements to
            support font and other at-rules directly might help maintenance of
            stylesheets.</para>
        <para>You can reuse fragments of stylesheets with a name/ref mechanism,
            but this has not been explored extensively.</para>
        <para>CSS Within could also do minification of CSS, and possibly
            automatic prefixing.</para>
        <para>The most likely short-term enhancement is automatic generation of
            match patterns. Future work on enhancing the Java plugin to support
            automatically generating CSS files even in the presence of separate
            compilation is also planned.</para>

        <title>Availability</title>
        <para>CSS Within is (or will be) freely available on gitlab, and can be
            used professionally if desired. Comments and patches are of course
            welcome.</para>

        <title>Conclusions</title>
        <para>The author has been using CSS Within for some time. The result is
            that going back to a stylesheet after some months to make a minor
            adjustment is now significantly easier, and even larger refactoring
            keeps the CSS and the HTML working together.</para>
        <para>The work involved in refactoring an existing stylesheet into CSS
            Within should not be underestimated, although even in small projects
            bugs and  inefficiencies are very likely  to be found and eliminated
            as part of this process.</para>
        <para>CSS Within is a useful way to manage CSS styling of XSLT-generated
            HTML or XML in small projects; whether it scales up to larger
            multi-person projects remains to be seen.</para>
